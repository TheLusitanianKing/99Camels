# 99 Camels

Ninety-nine LISP problems solved with OCaml.

## N.B.

This was an old repository with first commits dating of 2014 with (old) OCaml.

I decided to do it all again, this time in 2022, with more up-to-date OCaml.
And also, because there were a lot of missing solutions.

If you want to see the old stuff, I moved them to [archives/](archives).
