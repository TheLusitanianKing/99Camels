# 99 Camels
Ninety-nine LISP problems solved with OCaml.

## Progress

* Lists: 25 out of 27.
* Arithmetics: 11 out of 11.
* Logic and codes: 4 out of 5.
* Binary trees: 4 out of 15.

## N.B.
This is an old repository with first commits dating of 2014.

I decided to do it all again, this time in 2022, with more up-to-date OCaml and especially because there were a lot of missing solutions (had solved around ~35 out of the existing 99, mainly due to a lack of time).

If you want to see the old stuff, I moved them to [.archives/](.archives).
