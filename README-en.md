# 99 Camels
Ninety-nine LISP problems solved with OCaml.

## Progress
12 out of 99.

## N.B.
This is an old repository with first commits dating of 2014.

I decided to do it all again, this time in 2022, with more up-to-date OCaml and especially because there were a lot of missing solutions (had solved around ~35 out of the existing 99, mainly due to a lack of time).

If you want to see the old stuff, I moved them to [archives](archives).
